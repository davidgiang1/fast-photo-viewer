## Building from Source

Requires **FFmpeg 7.x** specifically (matches `ffmpeg-the-third 2.0`). FFmpeg 8.x will fail to build.

1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) (LLVM provides `libclang`, needed by `bindgen`).
2. Download FFmpeg 7.x **shared** libraries (e.g. an `n7.1` release from [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) or [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)) and extract into the project root, e.g. `./ffmpeg7/ffmpeg-n7.1-latest-win64-gpl-shared-7.1/`.
3. Create `.cargo/config.toml` so Cargo can find it:
    ```toml
    [env]
    FFMPEG_DIR = { value = "ffmpeg7/ffmpeg-n7.1-latest-win64-gpl-shared-7.1", relative = true }
    ```
   `relative = true` resolves the path against the project root. Adjust the path to match where you extracted FFmpeg, or use an absolute path with `relative = false`.
4. Build:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
5. The binary will be at `target/release/fast-photo-viewer.exe`. Copy the FFmpeg DLLs from `<FFMPEG_DIR>/bin/` alongside it.
